If you are using panel and wings on the same machine, you need to select the same option in both panel and wings installations.

    <p>
      If your cloud hosting provider has an external firewall, which you have
      configured to your needs, using system firewall is not necessary.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self_hosting" label="Self Hosting">
    <p>
      If your router is not forwarding all ports and you are not using DMZ it is
      not necessary to use system firewall.
