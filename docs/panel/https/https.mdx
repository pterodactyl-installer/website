* Do you want to automatically configure HTTPS using Let's Encrypt? (y/N):
```

SSL is that little green lock icon that you see on the top left of your browser, when visiting a secure website.

![SSL](./ssl.png)

It is what tells that the website is using an encrypted connection.  
If you want to use SSL for your panel, you will need to create a certificate for your domain.

There are 2 ways in the script to set up SSL:

- Using Let's Encrypt
- Using your own certificates

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="lets_encrypt" label="Let's encrypt" default>
    <p>
      It's easy to set up SSL using Let's Encrypt. The script will automatically
      try to create a certificate for your domain.
    </p>
    <CodeBlock>
      * Do you want to automatically configure HTTPS using Let's Encrypt? (y/N):
      y
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ssl_certs" label="SSL certificates">
    <p>
      This way certificates are created manually by the user. After installation
      for a working panel you will need to place certificates in the following
      locations:
      <br />
      Public certificate: <code>/etc/ssl/{"<domain>"}.pem</code>
      <br />
      Private certificate: <code>/etc/ssl/{"<domain>"}.key</code>
    </p>

      n <br />* Assume SSL or not? (y/N): y
